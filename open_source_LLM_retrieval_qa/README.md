# Building a retrival-based Question Answering system using LangChain + Ray in 20 minutes

This is source code for "Building a retrival-based Question Answering system using LangChain + Ray in 20 minutes"

## Requirements 

This demo requires a bit of a hefty setup. It requires one machine with a 24GB GPU (eg. an AWS g5.xlarge) or a machine with 2 GPUs 
(minimum 16GB each) or a Ray cluster with at least 2 GPUs available. 

It probably will be too slow if you run it on your own M2 mac. 

## Getting started

Once you have a cloud machine with the required specifications, do `pip install ray[default]`

To apply this to the Ray docs, use `tar xvfz`.
